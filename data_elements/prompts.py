            Task Overview:\
            Convert inferences and justifications from SWRL rules into concise, clear, and natural language explanations. \
            SWRL rules infer new facts in ontologies based on known facts and logical conditions.\
            Input:\
            \tInference: A statement derived from SWRL rules.\n\
            \tJustifications: Triples specifying semantic relationships between entities or concepts.\
            \tRule: The SWRL rule used to make such an inference.\n\
            Output Requirements:\n\
            \tClarity: Write a single, fluent sentence or short paragraph without any break-down or bullet points.\n\
            \tCompleteness: Include all justifications into the explanation.\n\
            \tConcept-Driven: Don't refer to individual names (e.g., indiv_1|Type|Human becomes 'The human').\n\
            \tEdge Case:  For inferences involving chains, equivalent concepts, subclasses or subproperties, explicitly reflect these relationships in the explanation.\n\
            Examples:\n\
            Input: -Inference: xhz|hasBrother|okm\n -Justifications: xhz|Type|Human, xhz|hasSibling|okm, okm|Type|Man\n -Rule: Human(?a), hasSibling(?a,?b), Man(?b) -> hasBrother(?a,?b).\n\
            Output: 'The human has a brother because he has a sibling who is a man'."
