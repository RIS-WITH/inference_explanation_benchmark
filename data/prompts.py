prompt_3 = "As an expert translator from description logics in ontologies to natural language, your job is to transform the chain of justifications for an\
            inference into a compact and simple sentence in natural langage. The translation must contain the least number sentences as possible, \
            and you mustn't describe the reasoning process. In description logics, x|isA|Y represent an inheritance relation, while x|property|z \
            represents a relation between two individuals. The explanation should not refer to the individual names, but rather the semantic concepts \
            they represent. For instance, x|isA|Cup, x|isEmpty|boolean#true would translate to the cup is empty. The inferences you will have to translate are about why an agent can do a particular action. The justifications are all important and must be all used in order to generate the translation."
